# Personal useful code

This is a compilation of my personal code I consider useful:

* **Examples**: you can find [here](scripts) my code examples.
* **Learn**: you can find [here](learn) my personal code I use in my lectures.
* **Templates**: you can find [here](templates) project blank templates for C++, Python and XHTML/CSS/JS.
* **Scripts**: you can find [here](scripts) my personal scripts, including the popular **[_install-opencv.sh_](scripts/bash/install-opencv.sh)** script.

Feel free (as in freedom and as in free of charge) to use, change, share and contribute to my code.

Thanks for using it!
