## My code



### Learn to code in different programming languages

The same line of code but in different languages.

0. **Hello, world!** (**[PHP](learn/00/00.php)**, **[JavaScript](learn/00/00.js)**, **[Python](learn/00/00.py)**).
1. **Variables** (**[PHP](learn/01/01.php)**, **[JavaScript](learn/01/01.js)**, **[Python](learn/01/01.py)**).

I use it only for didactic purposes, it does not cover all the characteristics of each language.

### Scripts

You can find [here](scripts) my personal scripts, including the popular [_install-opencv.sh_](scripts/bash/install-opencv.sh).
