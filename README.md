# Scripts for Ubuntu/Debian

This is a compilation of my scripts in Ubuntu or Debian that I consider useful. Feel free to use and change the scripts as you like.

### How to run the scripts

To run the scripts, open a terminal console and execute:

```
bash name_of_the_script.sh
```

### Order of execution

1. Install command-line interface (CLI) software ([link](https://github.com/milq/scripts-ubuntu-debian/blob/master/install-cli-software.sh)).
