## Scripts for Ubuntu/Debian

This is a compilation of my scripts in Ubuntu or Debian that I consider useful. Feel free to use and change the scripts as you like.

### 1. Order of execution to set up Ubuntu or Debian once first installed

When I have just installed Ubuntu or Debian I execute a serie of scripts to set up my GNU/Linux OS. The order is the following:

1\. Install additional CLI (command-line interface) and GUI (graphical user interface) software ([script](https://github.com/milq/scripts-ubuntu-debian/blob/master/scripts/bash/install-additional-software.sh)).
2 (optional). If you use Debian with XFCE, install Numix.
