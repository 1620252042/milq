# Bash scripts for Ubuntu and Debian

This is a compilation of my scripts in Ubuntu or Debian that I consider useful.

### 1. Order of execution to set up Ubuntu or Debian once first installed

When I have just installed Ubuntu or Debian I execute a serie of scripts to set up my GNU/Linux OS. The order is the following:

**1\.** Install additional CLI (command-line interface) and GUI (graphical user interface) software running this [script](https://github.com/milq/scripts-ubuntu-debian/blob/master/scripts/bash/install-additional-software.sh).

**2 (optional).** , run this [script](https://github.com/milq/milq/blob/master/scripts/bash/install-numix-xfce-debian.sh).

**3 (optional).** If you use Debian with XFCE and want to install secondary school educational software, run this [script](https://github.com/milq/milq/blob/master/scripts/bash/install-additional-educational-software.sh).
